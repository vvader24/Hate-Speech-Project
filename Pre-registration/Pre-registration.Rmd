# OSF Project Name: Identifying Hate speech

### BROAD RESEARCH QUESTION: 


### A PRIORIâ€“SPECIFIED PROCEDURE FOR EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSES

Supervised learning algorithms will be used to predict hate and non-hate speech. Roberta based models will be used to compute sentence embeddings. 
\n

1. The data will be split into training and testing sets using in the ratio of 80-20. 

2. Supervised learning models will be applied to predict if the text is hate speech or non-hate speech. Models will be built using the following three approaches:
   + Regularized Regression 
   + Random forest
   + Gradient boosted trees
   
3. Comparisons will be carried out between the three model performances.
4. Algorithmic bias between the models will be assessed.
